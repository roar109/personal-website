As many developers start using git is hard at the begining for that we must search on every blog online to find some good and usable information, I'll post some of the most commons commands I used for a couple of months I worked with github and git in general.

###Basics
Repo initiation
<code>git init</code>
Create a new git structure and ready to do the first add command.

Add files to git control
<code>git add file1 file2 ...  file n</code> or <code>git add .</code> add all the files

Sho status of your files in the project
<code>git status</code>

Commit files
<code>git commit -m "Some message for your commit"</code>

Push changes to the remote repository
<code>git push</code>

Pull change from remote repository
<code>git pull</code>

Create a new branch from master
<code>git checkout -b branchName</code>

Switch between existing branches
<code>git checkout master</code>

Merge branches into the working branch
<code>git merge branchName</code>

I will gather more commands and update the post with them.
