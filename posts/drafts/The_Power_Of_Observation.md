# The power of observation #

Is easy to have a conversation with someone but what is not easy is to really be aware of the path that is going to follow, something like: akward silence, self-talking people, egocentric maniacs, passive talkers; all kinds of people are well known types of chatty, so the problem is can we detect what kind of people are before or while we are talking?

Here comes in the play the power of observation, is simple to know the gestures, the mods, the voice level of a person while is talking, but know why is talking in that way, what is he/she trying to do or to share with you is not so easy.

I will give a small explanation about what I think is needed in order to know more about other people using the power of observation.

### Body language
Is easy to recognize one's face in a long distance, what is not easy is know with some level of certain what is trying to show or feel to us, the shy gesture of the hands, the heat in the face, hands rub, itchy neck and so on.

First contact is everything when you try to share an idea with someone; could be the first hand shake, first eye contact, first dominant posture; if you are trying to be the one who take charge of the conversation be the dominant but this is not the best for a healthy conversation the receiver would be in a blocker manner one way to see this is the crossed arms or the way the look without blinks is a easy way that are not putting attention to your comments.

### Facial expressions
I notice something specially in women when they don't like anything, usually they make an expression like disgust or displeasure, this kind of sign is very important with this you can detect how the initial hand-shake will be, if is friendly, aggressive, or in self-defense mode.

Small gestures like smile, eyes open, dilated eyes, etc, will tell you whoe to start. I will not explain in detail what are the points to check, but just a comment what you can do in order to determine the mod of the people.

One good experiment is go to a mall and look the people (don't stare them that is harassment), sit and drink coffee and look the couples, people talking and you will see all of this, in combination with voice and body language this tell you the mod of the people, how they handle situations.

### Common sense

This is the main reason people don't look beyond his own noses and purposes, needs some level of introspection in out person, ask for yourself this questions:

* When you are angry, do you yell at others or wait and double thinkg before throwing the axe?.
* Do you ever ask yourself why are you in that way?
* Do you ever ask others what they think about your person?
* Why everyone tell the same thing? Really?, should be tell you what everyone else is trying to explain to you...

### Conclusion?

There is no conclusion, there is a lot of information about human emotions and how we can use them to interact in a relationship, for work, speeches and a lot of topics. If you notice this kind of doubts rising, you can do some research and try yourself, is the only way you can tell for true if this works for you.

I myself do this kind of often just to practice, maybe a thoug meeting so adopt a dominant posture to be more securefor saying an example.
