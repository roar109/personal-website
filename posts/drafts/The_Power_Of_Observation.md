# The power of observation #

Is easy to have a conversation with someone but what is not easy is to really be aware of the path that is going to follow: akward silence, self-talking people, egocentric maniacs, passive talkers; all kinds of people are well known types of chatty, so the problem is we can detect that kind of people before or while we are talking?

Here comes in the play the power of observation, is simple to know the gestures, the mods, the voice level of a person while is talking, but know why is talking in that way, what is he/she trying to do or to share with you is not so easy.

I will give a small explanation about what I think is needed in order to know more about other people using the power of observation.

### Body language
Is easy to recognize one's face in a long distance, what is not easy is know with some level of certain what is trying to show or feel to us, the shy gesture of the hands, the heat in the face, hands rub, itchy neck and so on.

First contact is everything when you try to share an idea with someone could be first hand shake, first eye contact, first dominant posture; if you are trying to be the one who take charge of the conversation be the dominant but this is not the best for a healthy conversation the receiver would be int a blocker manner one way to see this is the crossed arms or the way the look without blinks is a easy way that are not putting attention to your comments.

### Facial expressions

### Common sense

This is the main reason people don't look beyond his own noses and purposes, needs some level of introspection in out person, ask for yourself this questions:

* When you are angry, do you yell at others or wait and double thinkg before throwing the axe?.
* Do you ever ask yourself why are you in that way?
* Do you ever ask others what they think about your person?
