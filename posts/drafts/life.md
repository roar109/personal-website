Life is short, life is what we left in this world, is what  our offspring remember and the people of us; is what you choose in life and what we left in the end, what we try to acomplish and what we get at the end of the tunnel, the final light, what we get from the end of the storm, what we see in the end of the desert, a memory, a unique memory.

**R.I.P.**

**Regret nothing, always love, laugh often... live forever**
