# Conscious Incompetence

Some time ago I start staring at some coworkers when they are trying to solve an issue and I came with the realization that your solving experience is not always helpful, is part of a complete solution that your brain does, even if you did something a day before now you are facing the same problem and you don't know how to solve it - but you should - the knowledge you got in that moment is not clear or was not interesting enough to remember it or try to improve it and so on.


I take this four stages of competence from a post I like, this stages are what I was trying to identify some time ago:

**Four stages of competence:**

* **Unconscious Incompetence:** you are not aware of lacking skills and knowledge to solve a problem. For instance, when your friend offers you his help in mounting your freshly ordered bed and it collapses after two days, you know that you got help from an unconsciously incompetent person, assuming that your friend had no bad intentions.

* **Conscious Incompetence:** same as stage 1, except that you are aware of what skills and knowledge have to be acquired to become competent in a field. When a new Javascript library becomes viral, most likely you become consciously incompetent by the time you want to use it for the first time.


* **Conscious Competence:** this is the state where professional solutions can be delivered. The only problem is that you need to actively concentrate and pay attention during the process. This stage is still sufficient most of the time. In fact, some people never reach step 4. I recall an old-fashioned shop I visited during my holidays. I purchased 3 products, each costing 1 Euro. I saw the cashier guy reached for his calculator and entered 1 times 3. Then he asked for 3 Euros. The process is fully bulletproof. It is in fact anchored into him. Yet, he has to think about it, while most people would just ask for the 3 Euros, without even consciously thinking.


* **Unconscious competence:** this is where your skills shine. You solve problems without making a conscious effort. In fact, this state of competence is required in emergency situations. You may know everything about traffic rules, but it takes a lot more to successfully avoid an accident or detect aquaplaning on time.
